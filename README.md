# SRO-RTDP

**Objectives:**

1. Develop software platform capable of configuring and launching various existing software and hardware SRO components as a complete chain.

2. Develop monitoring system capable of monitoring performance of all components specifically for identifying bandwidth and compute bottlenecks.

3. Develop proxy components that can effectively simulate performance of specific hardware or software components that do not currently exist.

4. Develop multi-stream software source that can take existing experimental or simulated data and broadcast it into the system with time structure and stream count that mimics a running experiment.

5. Configure a system comparable in size and bandwidth to a future JLab experiment (e.g. SoLID) which includes a 400Gbps transfer requirement from the counting house to the Computer Center, at least one FPGA component and one GPU component for at-scale testing.

6. Identify potential issues relevant to a future HPDF in receiving and processing SRO data, including from remote, non-JLab experiments.
